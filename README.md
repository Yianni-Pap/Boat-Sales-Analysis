# Boat_Sales_Analysis_with_Python

## Project Summary

As a data analyst for a yacht and boat sales website, I have been tasked with providing insights for the marketing team's weekly newsletter. The newsletter aims to assist boat sellers in gaining more views for their boats while staying up-to-date with market trends. To achieve this, I have examined the recent data and have formulated potential questions for analysis. 
These include:
- Determining the countries with the most viewed boats
- Identifying correlations between features (length and width) , price and most viewed boats


## Data Summary 

The dataset found on Kaggle provides information on the sales of boats over the past 10 years. It includes data such as the manufacturer, model, size, and year. It also has information on the price, type of hull, and engine type. The dataset can be used to examine trends in boat sales, the prices people are willing to pay for different boats, and how certain boat features affect sales. It can also be used to compare boat offerings between different manufacturers or to understand how certain models are doing compared to others.
